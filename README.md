One man came down from the heavenly mountains, whose name is spoken with a capital letter, a man who became a legend during his lifetime, a man who created an era and became an era himself, a man I honor and respect - he taught me. In fact, I divide all my code into several projects for the following reasons:

*The code is separated, not jumbled, which makes it easy to read and understand

*Code flexibility

*And it's just much more pleasant and easier for me to work with a project that is so well structured and divided
